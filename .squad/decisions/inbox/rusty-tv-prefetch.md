# Decision: TradingView Pre-Fetch Architecture

**Date:** 2025-07-17
**Author:** Rusty (Agent Dev)
**Status:** Implemented
**Commit:** 9bca215

## Context

The LLM agent unreliably executes 3+ sequential Playwright browser tool calls — it skips pages, fabricates navigation errors, or ignores tool-calling instructions. Multiple instruction-based fixes were attempted (reordering pages, innerText extraction via browser_run_code, reducing snapshot size) — none solved the fundamental problem.

## Decision

Pre-fetch ALL TradingView data deterministically in Python, then pass it to the agent as text. The agent receives NO browser tools — it only analyzes.

## Implementation

1. **New module `src/tv_data_fetcher.py`**: `TradingViewFetcher` class uses the same Playwright MCP tools (browser_run_code, browser_navigate, browser_click, browser_snapshot) but driven from Python, not the LLM.
2. **`src/agent_runner.py`**: Branches on `mcp_provider == "tradingview"` — pre-fetch path creates ChatAgent with no tools; all other providers use existing MCP-tool flow unchanged.
3. **TV instruction files**: Phase 1 rewritten from "gather data via browser tools" to "review pre-fetched data". All `browser_*` references removed. Phase 2 analysis logic, trading rules, output format, decision criteria unchanged.

## Trade-offs

- **Pro**: 100% reliable data fetching — Python deterministically loads all 3 pages every time
- **Pro**: Agent context is smaller and cleaner — only data + analysis instructions, no tool-call overhead
- **Pro**: Non-tradingview providers completely unaffected
- **Con**: Agent cannot adaptively explore pages (e.g., try different expirations) — but this was unreliable anyway
- **Con**: Pre-fetch always loads all 3 pages even if one would suffice — acceptable overhead

## Impact

- Covered call and CSP agents using TradingView provider should now consistently analyze all 3 data sources (technicals, forecast, options chain) instead of randomly skipping 1-2 pages.
