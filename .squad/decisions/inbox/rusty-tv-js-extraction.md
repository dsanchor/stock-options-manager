# Decision: Use browser_run_code for TradingView Technicals & Forecast

**Date:** 2025-07
**Author:** Rusty
**Status:** Implemented

## Context
The TradingView agent uses Playwright MCP to scrape 3 pages. `browser_navigate` returns full accessibility snapshots: technicals ~48K chars, forecast ~38K chars, options chain ~37K+65K expanded. Total ~188K chars was overwhelming the model context, causing it to report "pages failed to load."

## Decision
Use `browser_run_code` (Playwright JS execution) for technicals and forecast pages. This navigates to the page AND extracts `innerText` in a single call, returning ~3K and ~2.4K chars respectively (15-16x reduction). Options chain stays on `browser_navigate`+`browser_click`+`browser_snapshot` because it needs accessibility tree element refs for interactive clicking.

## Trade-offs
- **Pro:** ~80K chars freed per analysis run — model no longer chokes on context
- **Pro:** `innerText` contains identical data in cleaner tab-separated format
- **Pro:** Single tool call per page vs navigate+wait+snapshot
- **Con:** `browser_run_code` returns plain text, not structured accessibility tree — cannot use element refs for clicking (not needed for these pages)
- **Con:** If TradingView changes DOM structure (e.g., removes `<main>` tag), the fallback to `document.body` still works but may include more noise
