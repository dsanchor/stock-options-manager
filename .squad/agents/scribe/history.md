# Project Context

- **Project:** options-agent
- **Created:** 2026-03-26

## Core Context

Agent Scribe maintains squad administrative work: orchestration logs, session logs, decision merging, history summarization, git commits.

## Recent Updates

📌 2026-09-06T20:57:09Z: Consolidated portfolio movement workflow directives — orchestration log, session log, decision merge (3 new sections), inbox cleared (3 files archived), identity updated to deployed state, git commit and push
📌 2026-09-06T00:37:00Z: Finalized portfolio unified implementation documentation — orchestration log, session log, decision merge, 80 KB inbox archived, agent history updates, no commits (as instructed)
📌 2026-08-17T15:08:37Z: Logged Buy Tracker normalization and OpenCallMonitor zero-quote work; consolidated five Buy Tracker inbox decisions into the canonical shared log; removed merged inbox files; summarized oversized agent histories; committed `.squad/` state only.
📌 2026-07-15T08:43:28Z: Processed Rusty symbol-data-toggle — orchestration log, session log, decision merge, Rusty history summarization (13.8KB → 6.3KB), git commit  
📌 2026-06-26T15:06:04Z: Processed Rusty scheduler analysis — orchestration log, session log, decision merge (DPS fix), cross-agent history updates (danny, linus), git commit (0220c94), no archival needed  
📌 2026-04-08T12:55:00Z: Spawned Rusty (error count metric) — orchestration log, session log, decision merge, history update, git commit  
📌 2026-04-02T22:13:22Z: Merged spawn manifest tasks (2 Rusty items) — orchestration log, session log, decision merge, history update, git commit

📌 2026-03-31: Spawned Rusty (alert visibility fix) — orchestration log, session log, decision merge, history summarization to <12KB
📌 Team initialized on 2026-03-26

## Learnings

- History files >12KB need summarization with Core Context section
- Use ISO 8601 UTC timestamps (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) for all logs
- Decision inbox items must be merged to decisions.md with deduplication
- Affected agent history files should be updated with cross-team work summaries

## Orchestration Log Entry (2026-04-02)
- Processed dashboard timeframe migration for Linus (Quant Dev)
- Merged 4 inbox decisions into main decisions.md
- Created orchestration and session logs
- Updated Linus team history with task completion record
