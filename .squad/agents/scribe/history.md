# Project Context

- **Project:** options-agent
- **Created:** 2026-03-26

## Core Context

Agent Scribe maintains squad administrative work: orchestration logs, session logs, decision merging, history summarization, git commits.

## Recent Updates

📌 2026-08-17T15:08:37Z: Logged Buy Tracker normalization and OpenCallMonitor zero-quote work; consolidated five Buy Tracker inbox decisions into the canonical shared log; removed merged inbox files; summarized oversized agent histories; committed `.squad/` state only.
📌 2026-07-15T08:43:28Z: Processed Rusty symbol-data-toggle — orchestration log, session log, decision merge, Rusty history summarization (13.8KB → 6.3KB), git commit  
📌 2026-06-26T15:06:04Z: Processed Rusty scheduler analysis — orchestration log, session log, decision merge (DPS fix), cross-agent history updates (danny, linus), git commit (0220c94), no archival needed  
📌 2026-04-08T12:55:00Z: Spawned Rusty (error count metric) — orchestration log, session log, decision merge, history update, git commit  
📌 2026-04-02T22:13:22Z: Merged spawn manifest tasks (2 Rusty items) — orchestration log, session log, decision merge, history update, git commit
📌 2026-04-03T08:00:39Z: Spawned Linus (CosmosDB fix script) — orchestration log, session log, history update, git commit
📌 2026-04-01T10:51:20Z: Spawned Rusty (chat conversationalization) — orchestration log, session log, decision merge, history update
📌 2026-03-31: Spawned Rusty (alert visibility fix) — orchestration log, session log, decision merge, history summarization to <12KB
📌 Team initialized on 2026-03-26

## Learnings

- History files >12KB need summarization with Core Context section
- Use ISO 8601 UTC timestamps (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) for all logs
- Decision inbox items must be merged to decisions.md with deduplication
- Affected agent history files should be updated with cross-team work summaries

## Orchestration Log Entry (2026-04-02)
- Processed dashboard timeframe migration for Linus (Quant Dev)
- Merged 4 inbox decisions into main decisions.md
- Created orchestration and session logs
- Updated Linus team history with task completion record

### Orchestration Session (2026-07-01T20:11:24Z)

**Task:** Linus DTE Target & Post-Earnings Block Update — Scribe Orchestration

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Actions Performed**
1. ✅ Orchestration log: `.squad/orchestration-log/2026-07-01T20:11:24Z-linus.md`
2. ✅ Session log: `.squad/log/2026-07-01T20-11-roll-dte-earnings.md`
3. ✅ Decision merge: Appended to `.squad/decisions/decisions.md`, deleted inbox file
4. ✅ Cross-agent update: Appended to `.squad/agents/basher/history.md`
5. ✅ Git commit: `feat: update roll DTE target and post-earnings block windows` (commit 76c5dae)

**History Archival Status**
- ⚠️ Basher: 16KB (>12KB threshold) — requires archival
- ⚠️ Danny: 34KB (>12KB threshold) — requires archival
- ⚠️ Linus: 152KB (>12KB threshold) — requires archival
- ⚠️ Rusty: 107KB (>12KB threshold) — requires archival
- ✅ Ralph: 0KB
- ✅ Scribe: 1KB

**Deferred:** History summarization/archival for 4 files flagged for future archival session. Each file needs careful review of dated entries and consolidation into Core Context sections.
