# Project Context

- **Project:** options-agent
- **Created:** 2026-03-26

## Core Context

Agent Scribe maintains squad administrative work: orchestration logs, session logs, decision merging, history summarization, git commits.

## Recent Updates

📌 2026-04-02T22:13:22Z: Merged spawn manifest tasks (2 Rusty items) — orchestration log, session log, decision merge, history update, git commit
📌 2026-04-01T10:51:20Z: Spawned Rusty (chat conversationalization) — orchestration log, session log, decision merge, history update
📌 2026-03-31: Spawned Rusty (alert visibility fix) — orchestration log, session log, decision merge, history summarization to <12KB
📌 Team initialized on 2026-03-26

## Learnings

- History files >12KB need summarization with Core Context section
- Use ISO 8601 UTC timestamps (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) for all logs
- Decision inbox items must be merged to decisions.md with deduplication
- Affected agent history files should be updated with cross-team work summaries

## Orchestration Log Entry (2026-04-02)
- Processed dashboard timeframe migration for Linus (Quant Dev)
- Merged 4 inbox decisions into main decisions.md
- Created orchestration and session logs
- Updated Linus team history with task completion record
