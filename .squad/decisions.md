# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### 1. Trading Agent Instructions Design
**Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Author:** Linus (Quant Dev)  
**Status:** Completed  
**Impact:** Team-wide (defines agent behavior)

#### Context
Created system prompt instructions for covered call and cash-secured put agents. These instructions define how Azure AI Agents will analyze market data and make trading decisions.

#### Key Design Decisions

1. **Dual-Threshold Decision Framework**
   - **Standard SELL criteria**: Solid setups with IV Rank ≥50, proper Greeks, clean calendar
   - **CLEAR SELL SIGNAL criteria**: Exceptional setups (premium 2-2.5%, IV Rank ≥70) that trigger alerts
   - **Rationale**: Separates "good" opportunities from "don't miss this" opportunities

2. **Greeks-Based Strike Selection**
   - **Covered Calls:** Conservative (Δ 0.20-0.25), Moderate (Δ 0.25-0.30), Aggressive (Δ 0.30-0.35)
   - **Cash-Secured Puts:** Strike AT or BELOW support levels with same delta ranges
   - **Rationale**: Assignment on puts should happen at attractive prices (support), not above

3. **Standardized Output Format**
   - `[TIMESTAMP] SYMBOL | DECISION: SELL/WAIT | Strike: $X | Exp: YYYY-MM-DD | IV: X% | Reason: ... | Waiting for: ...`
   - **Rationale**: Enables easy parsing for decision logs and downstream analysis

4. **Fundamental Quality Gate (CSP Only)**
   - Mandatory check: "Would you want to own this stock at strike price?"
   - If NO → automatic WAIT regardless of premium
   - **Rationale**: Bad assignment on deteriorating stock wipes out months of premium

5. **Optimal DTE Window: 30-45 Days**
   - Balances premium amount with theta decay rate
   - Avoids <21 DTE (insufficient premium) and >60 DTE (too much time risk)
   - **Rationale**: Theta acceleration in final 30 days, but need enough time to manage position

6. **Earnings Calendar Integration**
   - **Covered Calls:** NEVER sell expiring after next earnings (gap risk)
   - **Cash-Secured Puts:** IDEAL to sell 1-3 days post-earnings (capture IV crush)
   - **Rationale**: Different risk profiles—calls fear upward gaps, puts benefit from volatility collapse

7. **MCP Tool Integration Strategy**
   - Phase 1: Core data (ticker, price history, options chain)
   - Phase 2: Volatility/sentiment (earnings calendar, fear/greed, trends)
   - Phase 3: Institutional context (holders, insiders)
   - **Rationale**: Systematic data gathering ensures no analysis gaps

#### Implications
- Instructions are Python string constants for Azure AI Agent's `instructions` parameter
- Decision logs must be appended to instruction context on each run
- CLEAR SELL SIGNAL marker enables alert detection in frontend
- Test edge cases: low IV, pre-earnings, post-earnings

#### Trade-offs
1. **Complexity vs. Flexibility**: Comprehensive (~12-18KB) to reduce hallucination
2. **Strict Rules vs. Agent Discretion**: Rules-based with interpretation room in "Reason" field
3. **Strike Selection**: Fixed delta ranges (0.20-0.35) per industry standard

### 2. Python Implementation Architecture (agent-framework SDK)
**Date:** 2024-03-26  
**Author:** Rusty (Python Dev)  
**Status:** In Progress (SDK migration from azure-ai-agents)  
**Impact:** Technical (defines project structure and integration points)

#### Context
Building complete Python project for periodic options trading agents with Azure AI Agents Framework and MCP integration.

#### Key Design Decisions

1. **Agent Framework SDK for Agent Management**
   - **Decision**: Use `agent-framework` SDK (correct) instead of `azure-ai-agents` (incorrect)
   - **Rationale**: Official framework for Microsoft Foundry with proper abstractions
   - **Impact**: Clean, maintainable code with proper resource cleanup

2. **Per-Symbol Agent Creation**
   - **Decision**: Create new agent for each symbol analysis, then delete after completion
   - **Rationale**: Avoids thread state accumulation, cleaner isolation, prevents cross-contamination
   - **Trade-off**: Slightly higher latency per symbol, worth it for reliability

3. **Dual-Log Strategy**
   - **Decision**: Maintain decision log (all decisions) and signal log (SELL only)
   - **Rationale**: Decision log captures history for context; signal log enables quick trader review
   - **Impact**: Better UX—traders know exactly where to look for actionable signals

4. **Context Continuity via Log Reading**
   - **Decision**: Read last 20 decision log entries and include in each analysis prompt
   - **Rationale**: Agents learn from previous decisions, avoid flip-flopping, provide temporal context
   - **Implementation**: `read_decision_log()` called before each analysis run

5. **Simple Scheduling with Python `schedule` Library**
   - **Decision**: Use `schedule` library instead of cron or APScheduler
   - **Rationale**: Simple readable syntax, no external dependencies, easy to test/debug
   - **Trade-off**: Less robust than systemd timers, sufficient for this use case

6. **Environment Variable Substitution in Config**
   - **Decision**: Support `${VAR_NAME}` syntax in config.yaml with validation
   - **Rationale**: Azure endpoints are sensitive and environment-specific
   - **Pattern**: Recursive substitution handles nested configs

7. **Separate Instruction Files**
   - **Decision**: Import instructions from separate files rather than inline strings
   - **Rationale**: Enables parallel development, cleaner separation of concerns
   - **Coordination**: Import pattern: `from covered_call_instructions import COVERED_CALL_INSTRUCTIONS`

#### Architecture
```
config.yaml → Config → AgentRunner → [CoveredCallAgent, CashSecuredPutAgent]
                          ↓
                  Agent Framework + MCP Tool
                          ↓
                Per-symbol analysis with decision context
```

#### Trade-offs
1. **Agent Reuse vs. Fresh Creation**: Chose fresh for isolation; can revisit if latency becomes issue
2. **Inline vs. File-Based Configs**: Chose files for easier management across environments
3. **Polling vs. Event-Driven**: Chose scheduled polling for simplicity and consistency

#### Current Issue
Used `azure-ai-agents` SDK in original implementation. Needs migration to `agent-framework` SDK. Architecture and patterns remain valid.

### 3. Switch MCP Server to mcp_massive
**Date:** 2026-03-26  
**Decider:** Rusty (Agent Dev)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Impact:** Team-wide (data source integration)

#### Context

The project was initially configured to use `iflow-mcp-ferdousbhai-investor-agent` as the MCP server for financial market data. Migration to `mcp_massive` from Massive.com (https://github.com/massive-com/mcp_massive) for improved data access and composable tool architecture.

#### Decision

Migrated all MCP server references and configuration from `iflow-mcp_ferdousbhai_investor-agent` to `mcp_massive v0.8.7`.

#### Rationale

- **Comprehensive API**: mcp_massive provides access to Massive.com's financial data API covering stocks, options, forex, and crypto
- **Built-in Analytics**: Includes Black-Scholes Greeks calculations (bs_price, bs_delta, bs_gamma, bs_theta, bs_vega, bs_rho)
- **SQL Querying**: Supports SQL-based data queries for flexible analysis
- **Technical Indicators**: Built-in SMA, EMA, and return calculations
- **Single Source**: Consolidates financial data access through one well-maintained API

#### Implementation

**Changed Files:**
1. `config.yaml` - Updated MCP command from `uvx --from iflow-mcp-ferdousbhai-investor-agent investor-agent` to `mcp_massive` with empty args
2. `src/agent_runner.py` - Changed MCPStdioTool name from `"investor-agent"` to `"massive"`
3. `.squad/team.md` - Updated MCP Data reference
4. `.squad/agents/rusty/charter.md` - Updated MCP Data Source in Tech Context
5. `.squad/agents/linus/charter.md` - Updated MCP Data Source in Tech Context
6. `README.md` - Updated all MCP server references and setup instructions

**Installation Requirements:**
```bash
uv tool install "mcp_massive @ git+https://github.com/massive-com/mcp_massive@v0.8.7"
export MASSIVE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

**Transport:** Stdio (unchanged) - MCP server launches as subprocess, no HTTP server needed.

#### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Access to comprehensive Massive.com financial data API
- Built-in Black-Scholes Greeks simplify options calculations
- SQL querying enables more flexible data analysis
- Reduced complexity with single API source

**Neutral:**
- Requires `MASSIVE_API_KEY` environment variable (similar to previous setup requirements)
- Installation via `uv tool install` (slightly different from uvx pattern)

**Mitigations:**
- Linus updated agent instructions to ensure compatibility with mcp_massive tools
- Fallback strategies documented for missing data signals

#### Next Steps

1. **Basher**: Test that MCP server launches correctly with `mcp_massive` command
2. **Danny**: Run end-to-end test to confirm agents can successfully fetch data and generate signals
3. **Team**: Verify that `MASSIVE_API_KEY` is documented and available in deployment environment

### 4. MCP Server Migration to Massive.com (Agent Instructions)
**Date:** 2026-03-26  
**Author:** Linus (Quant Dev)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Impact:** Team-wide (affects agent instructions and data gathering workflow)

#### Context

Migrated both covered call and cash-secured put agent instructions from the old `iflow-mcp-ferdousbhai-investor-agent` MCP server to the new `mcp_massive` from Massive.com. The old server had specific tool calls like `get_ticker_data()`, `get_price_history()`, `get_cnn_fear_greed_index()`, etc. The new Massive.com MCP server has a fundamentally different architecture with 4 composable tools and built-in analytical functions.

#### Key Design Decisions

**1. Discovery-First Workflow**
- **Decision:** Structure data gathering protocol around `search_endpoints` → `call_api` → `query_data` progression
- **Rationale:** The new MCP server is endpoint-agnostic; agents discover what they need rather than knowing tool names upfront
- **Impact:** Instructions now guide LLM through discovery phase before data collection

**2. In-Memory DataFrames with Meaningful Names**
- **Decision:** Use `store_as` parameter consistently with semantic table names (e.g., "price_history", "options_chain", "financials")
- **Rationale:** Enables SQL JOINs and cross-analysis in later steps
- **Pattern:** Phase 1: Store raw data tables → Phase 2: Store supplementary context → Phase 3: Query and analyze with SQL

**3. Built-in Functions for Greeks & Technicals**
- **Decision:** Leverage `apply` parameter extensively for Black-Scholes Greeks and technical indicators
- **Functions Used:** Greeks: `bs_delta`, `bs_gamma`, `bs_theta`, `bs_vega`, `bs_rho`; Technicals: `sma`, `ema`; Returns: `simple_return`, `cumulative_return`, `sharpe_ratio`
- **Rationale:** Avoid manual calculations; use optimized built-in functions for accuracy and speed

**4. Data Availability Adaptations**
- **Removed:** CNN Fear & Greed Index, Google Trends, Dedicated institutional holders endpoint, Dedicated insider trades endpoint
- **Alternatives:** Fear & Greed → News sentiment analysis; Trends → News volume; Institutional holders → Fundamentals; Insider trades → News parsing
- **Rationale:** Maintain decision quality with available data; apply conservative criteria when key signals missing

**5. Earnings Calendar Strategy**
- **Challenge:** No dedicated earnings calendar endpoint in Massive.com
- **Solution:** Multi-source: Check ticker_info for next earnings date field, parse news headlines for "earnings" mentions
- **Impact:** Instructions emphasize importance of earnings timing but acknowledge data may require manual validation

**6. Phased Data Gathering Structure**
- **Decision:** Maintain 3-phase structure (Core Data → Context → Analytics) with enhanced SQL capabilities
- **Rationale:** Logical progression mirrors decision-making process
- **Enhancement:** Phase 3 now includes explicit SQL examples for JOINs and `apply` functions

**7. Conservative Stance When Data Missing**
- **Decision:** Apply stricter criteria when key data unavailable (lower delta, higher margin of safety)
- **Examples:** If insider data unavailable → require stronger fundamentals; If Fear & Greed unavailable → focus on IV Rank; If earnings unclear → default to WAIT unless >60 days buffer
- **Rationale:** Incomplete information = higher risk; compensation required

#### Technical Implementation

**Covered Call Instructions Changes:**
- Phase 1: 4 steps (ticker details, price history with technicals, options chain, dividends)
- Phase 2: 5 steps (fundamentals, analyst ratings, news, sentiment proxy via news, retail interest via news volume)
- Phase 3: 3 steps (IV analysis, Greeks calculations, return metrics)
- Total: 12 data-gathering steps + 1 consolidation (granular and composable)

**Cash-Secured Put Instructions Changes:**
- Phase 1: 5 steps (ticker details, extended price history, dual financials, options chain, dividends)
- Phase 2: 6 steps (analyst ratings, news, earnings history via news, market movers, fear proxy, retail proxy)
- Phase 3: 6 steps (support via SQL, oversold conditions, Greeks, IV analysis, premium calculations, insider parsing)
- Total: 17 data-gathering steps + 1 consolidation (comprehensive analysis)

**SQL Examples Added:**
- Support identification: `SELECT MIN(low) FROM price_history` (CSP)
- Strike filtering: `SELECT * FROM options_chain WHERE delta BETWEEN 0.20 AND 0.35` (CC)
- Sentiment proxy: `SELECT sentiment FROM news GROUP BY sentiment`
- Greeks calculation: `SELECT ... apply=["bs_delta", "bs_theta"]`

#### Trade-offs

**Pros:**
1. More flexible: Discovery-based approach adapts to API changes
2. More powerful: SQL + built-in functions enable complex analysis
3. Better data integration: In-memory tables allow JOINs and cross-analysis
4. Composable: 4 simple tools combine for unlimited use cases

**Cons:**
1. More complex: Requires LLM to understand SQL and compose multi-step queries
2. More steps: 12-17 steps vs. 8-11 single tool calls (though more granular control)
3. Data gaps: Missing some signals (Fear & Greed, Google Trends, Insider Trades)
4. Discovery overhead: Each run requires `search_endpoints` calls

**Mitigations:**
- Provide extensive examples in instructions
- Document fallback strategies for missing data
- Emphasize semantic table naming for easier SQL composition
- Include explicit SQL templates for common queries

#### Success Criteria

- ✅ Instructions compile without syntax errors
- ✅ All available data gathering steps documented
- ✅ SQL examples tested for correctness
- ✅ Fallback strategies defined for missing data
- ⏳ Agent successfully gathers all available data
- ⏳ Agent makes same quality decisions as with old MCP server
- ⏳ No degradation in signal accuracy or timing
